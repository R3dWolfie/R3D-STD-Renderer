"""ffmpeg raw-RGB pipe — RENDER_PLAN.md §5.6 semantics on our stack; adapted
from the mania v2 encoder (OsuManiaRenderer_v2/osu_mania_renderer_v2/
encode.py: encoder probing order, rawvideo stdin input shape) simplified to
the synchronous single-process model the catch/taiko engines use.

Differences from the reference (§5.6) — deliberate:
  * ONE ffmpeg process, video on stdin + audio as a FILE input, instead of
    danser's two processes + mux step. Our audio is premixed offline
    (record/audio.py — NO BASS), so there is nothing to stream in
    lockstep; ffmpeg muxes in the same invocation.
  * Pixel path is rgb24 (renderer reads back RGB); the GPU RGB→YUV shader
    + PBO pool (§5.6 readback) is a later perf phase — mania v2's
    gpu/readback.py already proves it on this stack.
  * loudnorm (single-pass, I=-18:TP=-1.5, the 2026-07-31 audio directive)
    is applied to the audio filter chain like every in-house engine.

# x264) measured +16 to +23% aggregate throughput at 2-4 concurrent std renders
# at 720p and 1080p, +8% for one 1080p render, and nothing for one 720p render.

#                      R3D_STD_STOCK=1 also means the CPU preview)
#
# Asking is not getting: the local ffmpeg must first open a hardware session
# (`_vt_probe`); where it cannot, the preview stays on libx264. One failed
# output kills the whole ffmpeg process and with it the render, so when an
# ffmpeg that carried a hardware preview dies naming videotoolbox, the media
# engine is switched off for a day (`note_preview_failure`) and the next render
# on this node is on the CPU preview without anyone touching a setting.
#
# Settings (chosen on lossless captures of all four modes, see the PR): the
# same target bitrate as the x264 preview, in the encoder's CONSTANT-RATE mode
# with B-frames, behind a half-second LEAD-IN.
#
# Why each: in its default mode, and worse under a peak cap, this encoder
# makes a small first keyframe and then starves the rest of the first second
# (worst frame VMAF 28 with x264's 1.25x cap). Constant-rate mode with B-frames
# cures that at 1400 kbit/s, but a long replay gets a lower preview bitrate
# from the size budget (507 kbit/s at five minutes) and there the first
# keyframe is too small again: first half-second VMAF 42 against 66 for the
# rest. The lead-in is the cure that holds at every bitrate: the first frame
# is repeated for _VT_LEAD_S seconds in front of the video, so the rate
# control has banked about what x264 spends on its first keyframe by the time
# the real video starts; a keyframe is forced on the first real frame, and two
# bitstream filters drop the lead-in's packets and shift the rest back, so the
# file starts on that keyframe at time 0 with exactly the frames it had before
# (42 -> 73 on that replay, with nothing taken from the seconds after).
# Constant-rate mode also makes the file size exact, which is what
# preview_video_bps budgets for. Frames are scaled on the CPU exactly as
# before, so the encoder is the only thing that changes.
