"""Background-video decode — §4.10 LoadVideos on the R3D `load_video`
preset key. This is a PORT of the house implementation, mania v2's
video_bg.py (OsuManiaRenderer_v2/osu_mania_renderer_v2/video_bg.py) —
owner-directed: mania's is the reference; the only adaptations are the
plain `ffmpeg` prefix (no _ffmpeg_prefix() indirection here) and stderr
prints instead of the mania logger.

osu! maps can ship a background video (the ``Video,<start>,"file"`` event,
beatmap.video/video_offset). When enabled we play it behind gameplay,
decoding through ffmpeg — already a hard dependency for output encoding —
scaling+cropping each frame to *cover* the canvas (the same framing as the
static background) and resampling to the render fps, then reading raw RGBA
frames over a pipe.

A small reader thread pulls frames into a bounded queue so ffmpeg decodes a
few frames ahead while the GPU draws the previous one. The render loop
calls :meth:`frame_for` once per output frame with that frame's MAP time;
the decoder advances 1:1 at 1× (both sides run at the same fps after the
``fps`` filter). Under rate mods the map clock advances `speed`× per output
frame, so the loop drains proportionally more source frames — the video
fast-forwards exactly like stable under DT.

Returns ``None`` before the video's start offset, when decode failed, or
once it ends — the caller then falls back to the static background image
(matching osu!, which drops back to the bg image when the video finishes).
Every failure path is fail-soft: a missing/corrupt video must never kill a
render.
