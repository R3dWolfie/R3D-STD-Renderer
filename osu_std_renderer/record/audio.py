"""Offline audio mixing — the NO-BASS design (locked decision).

The reference (§5.6) runs BASS as a non-playing 48 kHz float decode mixer
and streams 1 ms of PCM per sim tick into a second ffmpeg process. BASS is
proprietary (free for non-commercial use only — the one real license item
in the danser stack, APPROACH.md §1.1). This engine replaces it the same
way mania/catch/taiko already do in production:

  1. decode the map's music (any codec) → float32 stereo 48 kHz numpy via
     an ffmpeg subprocess (decode_to_pcm);
  2. mix hitsound samples into a track buffer at event times with numpy
     adds (mix_at) — sample volumes from timing points / object extras
     (§3.4 semantics), rate-mods handled by resampling the music once;
  3. write the mixed track as .wav (write_wav) and hand it to the single
     ffmpeg encode as a file input (record/encode.py), where loudnorm
     (I=-14:TP=-1.5) runs like every in-house engine.

Determinism is preserved: mixing happens in map-time before encoding, so
encoder speed can't shift audio (the property §5.2 guards).
