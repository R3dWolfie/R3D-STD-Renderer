"""AUDIO OFF THE START (R3D_STD_AUDIO_LATE=1 in the CLI; default OFF).

Stock: the render cannot draw its first frame until the audio is mixed,
because the one ffmpeg process that encodes the video also reads the mixed
wav. The mix waits for the song's loudness-normalised decode, which runs at
about 25 times realtime and is cached per node: 18 s for a 7.5 minute song the
node has not rendered before, about 1 s of mixing and writing for one it has.

With the flag the frame loop starts at once. The video is encoded to
temporary files with no audio; a worker thread runs the SAME mix and then the
SAME audio filters and encoders as their own ffmpeg process, during the
render; when the frames are done the audio is joined to each output with a
stream copy. Nothing about the picture or the sound is computed differently.

Left on the stock path (the CLI decides): the streamable master and the live
preview, whose bytes are uploaded while they are written, and a non-zero
audio offset.
